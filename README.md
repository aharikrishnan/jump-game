# jump-game
A mulitplayer game that uses WebRTC.

## Playing
One player should press the host button.  Other players should press join, then use the host's code to join his game.  Once everyone presses the ready button, the game will begin.

The goal is to stay on the platforms.  The last player to fall wins.
